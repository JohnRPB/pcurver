# PCurveR

These are, or as it may, will be, functions to analyse and plot distributions of p values in R.

The initial plan is to simply duplicate the methods from the http://www.p-curve.com/ website. As time goes by, I hope to add some additional things. 

Any comments or ideas, raise an issue on the repo (top right if you're on the GitHub page right now).
